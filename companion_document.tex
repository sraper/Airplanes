\section{Future Directions \& Limitations}

\subsection{Flow Optimization}

One minor shortcoming of our solution as presented was its performance 
on so-called ``flow'' boards, characterized by large numbers  of planes that shared 
their source, destination, and departure times and so-named from the serialized 
flow of planes that would form between the source and destination.  While we
were able to improve our performance on these boards by adding flow detection
to the pre-simulation training in the code (implemented by detecting the presence
of five or more planes sharing a source an destination), our solution was limited
by the fact that only one flow of planes was allow between any source-destination
pair. On boards such as \ms{DiagonalFlows} with large amounts of free airspace, Group 5's
player was able to detect the possibility of multiple flows between the source and destination
and subsequently schedule planes to proceed to the destination in two slightly-staggered
flows. While the staggering (necessary for any particular plane to avoid collision with
a plane in another flow immediately at takeoff, before that other plane had cleared the 
airspace) severely reduced the runtime improvements of this strategy, it was nonetheless
better than a one-flow solution; Group 5's player demonstrated a runtime of 666 steps
on \ms{DiagonalFlows}, while our player demonstrated a runtime of 711 steps.\\

One could improve on this limitation by adding detection for multiple flow paths between
a source-destination pair during the training phase of our player. Our current implementation
of flow-detection works by finding a shortest path between the source-destination pair, treating
other flows as obstacles obstructing this path. One possibility would be to generate some number
of paths between the source-destination pair, determine which paths are close enough to the
optimal path as to not increase the overall runtime of the simulation after necessary 
staggering was taken into account, and dispatch planes to each of these flows in turn.
Potential implementation difficulties would be being able to determine prior to simulation
that such a splitting would not simply increase the runtime of the entire simulation.

\subsection{Pathfinding Prioritization / Sorting}

Another problem with our solution was the possibility of giving planes whose paths were 
determined last in the sequence of planes overly long paths. As outlined above, our
method of determining paths was greedy in that we would determine the path for any 
particular plane $P_i$ by simply simulating the shortest A* path between the source
and destination of $P_i$ in an environment with planes $P_0$...$P_{i-1}$, resetting
the simulation and trying again with a obstacle placed at the collision point in the
event of a collision. This methodology resulted in a greater number of collisions for the
last planes to have their path decided, which would lead them to be given longer paths to
avoid collisions. Problems arose in that the ordering for resolving plane paths was more-or-less
arbitrary; it was very possible that a plane with a short path in an optimal solution would be
given a longer path, potentially to the detriment of simulation runtime, due to the fact
that it had to consider more obstacles than other planes in determining its final path.\\

We attempted to address this problem by prioritizing the order with which planes' paths 
were determined in our pre-flight simulations. Methods tried include...\\

\begin{itemize}
  \item \ms{Shortest Path First:} Order the planes in ascending order by path length, and 
    resolve flight paths in that order. The intuition behind this was that shorter paths
    would have fewer intersections with other paths, and thus their resolution would generate
    fewer obstacles for later-resolved flights.
  \item \ms{Longest Path First:} Order the planes in descending order by path length, and
    resolve flight paths in that order. The intuition behind this was that longer flights
    are more likely to be the limiting factor in the overall runtime of the simulation, 
    so resolving them first would ensure their runtime would not be increased by collisions
    with shorter flights.
  \item \ms{Least Intersections First:} Determine the straight line paths between all
    source-destination pairs in the simulation. Order the planes in descending order by
    number of intersections with other straight line paths, and resolve flight paths in 
    that order. This method attempted to resolve flights that would be interfered with 
    by many other flights first, thus prevent their runtimes from skyrocketing.
\end{itemize}

In experiments, we found that each of the above methods yielded superior results in different
simulations, with no clear trend of certain strategies working better on certain maps. Due to the
fact that our implementation of sorting was incompatible with our flow detection, our final solution
ultimately scrapped prioritization of plane flights. One issue that would have to be solved if this
were implemented in the future would be gathering useful information for prioritizing flights from
the information that is available at the beginning of the simulation. One only knows when the simulation
starts what the source, destination, and departure time of each plane is. As of time of writing, we 
were unable to find any way of extrapolating from this data a prioritization that would reliably yield
better results on most boards.
