- 1. Sort planes from longest trip to shortest
- 2. Created list FINISHED
- 3. For plane in sorted order...
  - 1. Start assuming it leaves at its departure time.
  - 2. Check if at that time, it would conflict with any flights in FINISHED at that time
    - 1. 
  - 3. If yes, increase departure time by time for conflicting flight to clear that area. GOTO 2
       If no, add this flight to FINISHED. Map PLANE to TIME
- Fly planes according to PLANE -> TIME table.
